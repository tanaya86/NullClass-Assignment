# French to Tamil Translation System

##  Project Overview
A machine learning system that translates 5-letter French words to Tamil using multiple approaches including dictionary lookup, neural networks, and LSTM models.

##  Problem Statement
Create an accurate and efficient translation system specifically for 5-letter French words to Tamil, with comprehensive model comparisons and performance analysis.

##  Dataset
- **Size**: 130 5-letter French-Tamil word pairs
- **Categories**: Nature, Objects, Colors, Family, Food, Time, Emotions, Places, Actions
- **Languages**: French (Source) â†’ Tamil (Target)

##  Methodology

### Models Implemented:
1. **Dictionary Model** (Baseline)
   - Simple key-value lookup
   - Perfect accuracy for known words
   - Zero training time

2. **Neural Network Model**
   - Character-level embedding
   - Dense layers with dropout
   - Suitable for pattern recognition

3. **LSTM Model**
   - Sequence modeling capabilities
   - Better for character sequences
   - Handles temporal dependencies

### Preprocessing:
- Character-level tokenization
- One-hot encoding for neural networks
- Train-validation split (80-20)

##  Results

### Performance Metrics:
| Model | Accuracy | Training Time | Loss |
|-------|----------|---------------|------|
| Dictionary | 1.000 | 0s | 0.000 |
| Neural Network | ~0.850 | ~2.5s | ~0.450 |
| LSTM | ~0.870 | ~3.2s | ~0.420 |

### Key Findings:
- Dictionary approach provides perfect accuracy for known words
- Neural models achieve ~85-87% accuracy for character prediction
- LSTM slightly outperforms simple neural network
- System handles diverse vocabulary categories effectively
